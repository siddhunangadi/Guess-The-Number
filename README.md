<h2>Overview</h2>h2>
This project is a simple Number Guessing Game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. It's a small yet significant project for me, as it marks my first foray into the world of programming. Through this project, I’ve learned many fundamental concepts and practices that are crucial in software development.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>h3>
While working on this project, I gained hands-on experience with the following:

Basic Programming Concepts: Understanding variables, loops, and conditional statements.
User Input Handling: Capturing and processing user input to make the game interactive.
Random Number Generation: Implementing randomness in the game to generate the target number.
Logic Building: Developing the logic to compare the user's guess with the target number and provide feedback.
Error Handling: Implementing basic error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully.

<h3>How It Works</h3>
The program generates a random number between 1 and 20.
The player is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
The number of attempts is tracked, and the player is congratulated when they successfully guess the number.
